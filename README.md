Multi Pserve
=

Little script for you use in many pservers Pyramid


##How to
Install

    pip install multipserve

First, you can use the python script in your root directory application

    multipserver.py app1 app2 app3 app4

_app's are directory of applications_

##To do
Multi Pserve works but not how I think ... I want it to has a web page or even at the terminal(which I think unlikely/not functional) show the logs of active servers.

Look [issues](https://github.com/marioidival/multi_pserve/issues) for more details.

1. All application now are loaded in --reload mode
2. _multipserver_ create .log and .pid file for each application
