MultiPserve
===========


How To
------

First, you can use the python script in your root directory applications

    multipserver.py app1 app2 app3 app4


*app's* are directory of applications


Issues
------
Multi Pserve works but not how I think...  

I want it to has a web page or even at the terminal
(which I think unlikely/not functional) show the logs of active servers.

Look `issues <https://github.com/marioidival/multi_pserve/issues/>`_  for more details.


1. All application now are loaded in --reload mode
#. ``multipserver`` create .log and .pid file for each application
